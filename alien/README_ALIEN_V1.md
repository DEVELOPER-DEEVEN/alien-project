## About this Version

You are looking at the documentation for **ALIEN v1.0**. This was the very first release of the project. We keep it here for historical reference, but for all new projects, you should use the main ALIEN2 engine.

**Note**: This version is no longer actively maintained.

## What's Changed?

Since v1.0, we have introduced:
*   **ALIEN2**: A complete rewrite of the core engine for better speed and stability.
*   **Deep Windows Integration**: v2.0 works much better with system apps.
*   **Network Capabilities**: v1.0 was single-computer only.

## Historical Significance

ALIEN v1.0 was one of the first open-source agents to demonstrate "Zero-Shot UI Control." This means it could control applications it had never seen before by simply reading their screen, similar to how a human explores a new app.

This pioneering work laid the foundation for the advanced agents we use today!
